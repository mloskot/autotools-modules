# Autotools Modules

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since I no longer use GNU Autotools myself, I can not promise modules in this repository are actively maintained.
> I highly recommend you to use, and **contribute too**, modules in https://github.com/autoconf-archive/autoconf-archive

This is repository with modules, scripts and macros for
GNU Automake, Autoconf and friends.
